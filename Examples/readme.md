# PyDDSBB Example Notebook

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook provides a basic example of how to use **PyDDSBB** for optimizing simulation-based or black-box functions.

It demonstrates:

- How to set up and run the DDSBB optimization algorithm  
- The use of different types of underestimators within the solver  
- The information available at each node during the branch-and-bound process  
- Visualizations to help interpret the optimization progress and results  

This notebook serves as a starting point for applying **PyDDSBB** to custom black-box problems.
